1. Directory 'general' contains a few  test drivers to solve a distributed sparse 
   linear  system using preconditioned  (F)GMRES. The test matrix is 
   read from a file in the Harwell-Boeing format... 

2. Directory 'grid' contains test drivers related  to simple 2-D and
   3-D centered finite difference  elliptic PDEs on rectangular  domains.  

3. Directory 'petsc' contains a test driver to solve a linear system with PETSc. It also 
   contains the necessary files for pARMS to interface with PETSc. This allows 
   preconditioners in pARMS to be used as add-ons to PETSc.

4. In each of these 3 directories, there is also a directory called 'extras' which contains
   sample *.pbs and *.cmd scripts for submitting batch jobs for PBS scheduler and LoadLeveler
   respectively.

5. Directory 'matrices' contains some matrices stored in HB format.
