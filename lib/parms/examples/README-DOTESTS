NOTE: DOTESTS is a csh script

Check installation 
===================
If your architecture supports an interactive execution of parallel jobs, 
you may be able to use the DOTESTS script to check the installation and to 
observe the effect of various preconditioning options.
 
%DOTESTS grids  
  will run all preconditioners on sample grid problems
%DOTESTS general 
 will run all preconditioners on general matrices in the Harwell
 Boeing collection (see GENERAL -- and information related to the input file) 
 
%DOTESTS all    or   %DOTESTS 
 will run both suites 

The results of the runs will be located in the folder ./OUTPUTS/

For non-AIX machines, you will be asked by the script to provide 
hostfiles for your computing platform. You may terminate the script and 
create the proper hostfiles.

Script tuning
--------------
In the text of DOTESTS script, you  may modify  the number  of  processors 
(first  line after  header comments in  script) - 
but remember  that the number  of processors in GRIDS  should be  a multiple  
of npx  x npy  -- so  np cannot  be an arbitrary number.

Also, you can modify the option -machinefile which tells the program where to 
read the hostfile. On MSI blade machine, this option is -hostfile.
