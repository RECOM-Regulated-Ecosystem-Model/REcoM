This directory contains fortran interfaces to the pARMS functions. 
Any characters used in the FORTRAN  source code will be changed to all
lowercase  in object  files  for all architectures but  Cray. So,  the
interface functions to FORTRAN must be all lowercase (or all uppercase
for Cray).

NOTE: 

The following functions:
parms_mapcreatefromlocal_
parms_mapcreatefromglobal_
parms_mapcreatefromptr_
parms_mapcreatefromdist_
parms_mapcreatefrompetsc_

all have an MPI_Comm argument as part of their argument list. In fortran, this
argument is not used. It is merely included to make the call consistent with the
calling function in C. The default communicator used in this case is the 
MPI_COMM_WORLD communicator. This is to bypass a glitch in passing the MPI
communicator from a fortran environment, to a C environment. Hence the fortran 
user will have no choice but to have the map object defined over the entire domain.

In C however, a different communicator may be used without any compatibility issues.
